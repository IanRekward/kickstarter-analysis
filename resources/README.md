# Kickstarting with Excel


Overview of the Project
	Louise is a playwright and producer looking to fund an upcoming project via Kickstarter and wants to inform her approach 
based on an analysis of historical Kickstarter data. In this particular case, the goal is to Identify for Louise how different 
campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

Analysis and Challenges
	The alalysis is comprised of some general aggregation and transformation of the existing Kickstarter campaign data to derive 
descriptive statistics and charts to inform her decision. Two line charts illustrate the our findings below, but also highlight 
some of the limitations of this data. 

	Firstly, we only performed a analysis on a monthly timeframe. For further analysis I would recommend looking at years and months 
together to see if we can start to observe any effects of seasonality. These charts are also limited in what they can tell us 
relating to outliers. On a followup it would also be recommended to do an analysis of the standard deviation, variance, quartile ranges, 
and represent them with a box plot. 

Results and Recommendations
1: Based on this cross-sectional line chart, we can see that a majority of successfully funded campaigns for plays were launched in 
the May timeframe, with a diminishing proportion as the year goes on. 

2: We can also see that a sizable proportion of failed campaigns are also launched in the May timeframe, indicating that a majority 
of all campaigns are launched in May and the following three months. 

3: Additionally, we can observe that plays with funding targets of $35,000 - $45,000 have the highest rates of successful funding, 
so it is recommended that Louise develop her budget accordingly.
